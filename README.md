This game is an educational tool designed to help players memorise the 90% most common Hanzis found in the Chengshilun text. Combining elements of a classic falling block game with vocabulary learning, players must match the correct meaning to each Hanzi before it reaches the bottom of the screen. Itâ€™s an engaging and interactive way to reinforce recognition and understanding of these essential characters, making it perfect for students and enthusiasts of Chinese Buddhist texts.
